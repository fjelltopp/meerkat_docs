The Meerkat framework is developed and deployed using docker(www.docker.com). Docker provides lightweight containers that are completely replicable over many different development and production machines. For development we use docker-compose to administer these containers. This page will detail how to get the meerkat dev environment up and running. The following versions of docker are required:

* Docker >= 1.10
* docker-compose >= 1.6

Meerkat consists of three components: Abacus, Frontend and API. Each of these components have their own docker container. Then we have one docker container running nginx (a webserver), one container running Postgresql (main database), one container running RabbitMQ (lightweight database) and one container setting up the documentation.

To start of you will need to clone the three meerkat repositories (abacus, frontend and api) into a folder, then also clone the meerkat_docs into the same folder. The docker setup and docker-compose files are in the meerkat_demo repo, it needs to be cloned into the same folder as all the above repositories. You should then have a folder structure that looks like this::

  Top level folder
    - meerkat_abacus
    - meerkat_api
    - meerkat_frontend
    - meerkat_docs
    - meerkat_demo

To start the whole site it should only be required to start docker-compose in the meerkat_demo folder by running::

  $ docker-compose up -d 

The first time this command is run a lot of images are downloaded and many packages are installed. This will take some time. YOu can run it without the `-d` if you wish to view logs. Once the command has finished running you should have all the docker containers up and running. You can verify this by running (depending on how docker is setup you might need to use sudo)::

  $ docker ps

This site is now almost ready, we only need to setup some frontend resources by running::

  $ docker exec meerkatdemo_frontend_1 setup_static

This will download and install various NPM modules, download JS and CSS components via Bower and the run gulp to prepare all the static assets. After this you should be able to access the meerkat framework on localhost (or potentially some other address depending on how Docker is setup). To access the technical site the username/password is admin/secret. For development purposes it is useful to read up on docker and docker-compose commands. Mainly to restart containers and read the logs. The following command will show you a container's logs:

  $ docker-compose logs [service name: abacus, api, frontend, nginx, etc...]



The complete dev environment
-----------------------------

If using the infrastructure repository instead of the meerkat_demo repo you can follow exactly the same steps. Just run all commands from the dev folder and replace meerkat_demo with dev in the setup static command.  Make sure you have all of the following repos stored in a flat structure in a single directory:
* meerkat_frontend
* meerkat_abacus
* meerkat_api
* meerkat_infrastructure
* meerkat_docs
* meerkat_hermes
* meerkat_[country code] where country code can be "jordan", "mad" "dji" or "rms". 

The final repos are the country configs , and required for running any single country in the dev environment. Some of the repos require a connection to our Amazon Web Services (AWS) e.g. jordan and mad in order to include live data in the site.  To do this you will have to setup your aws credentials using the AWS CLI command `aws configure`. 

Known Issues:

* When copying credentials into the docker container (in `meerkat_infrastructure/dev/[country code].yml`) we assume credentials are stored in `~/.aws/credentials`. Note that if running docker-compose with sudo, it may look for the credentials in your root home directory not your personal home directory.
* On some systems (Fedora, RHEL) SELinux might be enabled causing permission errors when running some containers. Disabling it should solve permissions problems e.g. `requirements.txt not opened. Permission denied.`
